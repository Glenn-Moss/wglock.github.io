If I were to run into you in an elevator in a random building, I would say: 

Nothing. 

I mean, I would smile at you and probably ask what floor you were getting off at. I would offer to push a button for you... but... I wouldn't start pitching my expertise in biomedical engineering, Ui development, or user research. However, this bizarre phenomenon has, apparently, happened enough for people to expect elevator pitches. Ergo, let us suppose I have bumped into you in the elevator in the Empire State Building. As the elevator hurtles upward at about 1.3 floors a second, I would say:

Hi, my name is Will Glockner and I am a recent graduate from Tufts University. I am both a Biomedical Engineer and a Human Factors Engineer. Human factors engineering is a new field so let me break it down for you. Human factors engineering is equal parts mechanical engineering, ergonomics, psychology, design, product development, and coding.

A website for everyone

The website is compatible with narration and can call out 

Notes:

1. This is a live webpage: expect minor changes to be made on a daily basis

1. Check status by going to the repository settings, in the "GitHub pages" section


**Eventual Goals**

I have also created [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual markdown files that will be properly formatted for the JIKOFOJEOILJEFOI:JEFJ template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository.
