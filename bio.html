		<p> My Bio </p>

		<p>
			I was born to dirt poor farmers in South Dakota. However, I never 
			accepted them as my parents. In my own imagination, I was a son of God. 
			I was destined for glory. Chasing this dream, I fled from my home and 
			happened upon a crashed green Rolls Royce. The vehicle belonged to an 
			opioid addicted billionaire named Can Dody. I rushed to the damaged 
			green vehicle and pulled the man to safety. As I gazed into his green 
			eyes I realized this was my opportunity. In this instant, I changed my 
			name to “William Daniel Glockner III.” I spent the next several years 
			driving with him around the country. I learned how to fit in with the 
			upper-class and began, at last, to truly belong. Eventually, Can Dody 
			succumbed to his opioid addiction. I had expected to be included in his 
			inheritance, but I was deceived by a woman with a pair of fading, 
			bespectacled eyes. Her eyes had a solemn judging quality to them that
			would have been perfectly at home on an old advertising billboard. 
		</p>
		
		<p>
			I was dirt poor, again. I relentlessly chased after my dream and became 
			caught up in a perfectly legitimate business that sold everything 
			except bootlegged opioids. This business gave me the money to throw 
			ludicrously sized parties at my house. I kept hoping that one day a girl 
			that I had known years before would wander into my house, for no reason,
			and love would, at last, have found me. Despite the infallibility of this
			plan, I had yet to meet her.  
		</p>
		
		<p>
			Where did all the money come from… that’s all that Boston wanted to know.
			I thought wealth would bring friends, in fact, it attracts detractors.
